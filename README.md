# Cancer_Detection

In this notebook, we use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

The used dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics. The fields in each record are:

Field name	  Description
ID	          Clump thickness
Clump	        Clump thickness
UnifSize	    Uniformity of cell size
UnifShape	    Uniformity of cell shape
MargAdh	      Marginal adhesion
SingEpiSize	  Single epithelial cell size
BareNuc	B     are nuclei
BlandChrom	  Bland chromatin
NormNucl	    Normal nucleoli
Mit	          Mitoses
Class	        Benign or malignant
